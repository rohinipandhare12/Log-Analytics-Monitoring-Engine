# local cluster : it is a cluster used to develop and test or prove distributed computing locally before 
# deploying into main cluster
# without client, 
# we cannot know no.of workers exist in clusters
# we cannot know what is the task or where the task is running and cannot know status of dask 
# task : we cannot monitor the process of execution 
# with client: we can assign task to workers and can easily connect python code with dask and 
# can see the status of dask
